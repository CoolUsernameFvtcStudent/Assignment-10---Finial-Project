        <h2>Meet the Nacho Man Behind the Magic</h2>
        <p>It all started with one guy, a mountain of tortilla chips, and a dream. Marco Delgado, better known on the streets (and behind the fryer) as "Nacho Man," isn't your average food truck owner—he’s a full-blown nacho visionary.

        Back in 2019, Marco was just another office worker with a side obsession for perfecting the crunch-to-cheese ratio. Every lunch break, he’d sneak off to test new queso blends in his tiny apartment kitchen. Friends and coworkers couldn't stop raving about his wild nacho creations—sweet chili brisket, lime crema drizzle, even a mac ‘n’ cheese nacho monstrosity. One day, someone joked, “You should start a truck or something, Nacho Man!”
        
        So he did.
        
        Nacho Average Food Truck hit the streets in a beat-up van with two burners and a cooler full of cheese. Fast forward to today, and it's a rolling flavor fiesta, slinging loaded nachos that defy the laws of snack physics.
        
        And if you ever see a woman walk up to the window and ask, “Are you the owner?” Marco never misses a beat—he flashes a grin and goes,
        “I’m Nacho Man!”
        
        Whether you're here for a quick lunch or chasing us down at your next event, just know—you’re not eating from any food truck. You're eating from Nacho Average Food Truck.</p>
